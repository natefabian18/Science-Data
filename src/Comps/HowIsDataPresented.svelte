  <p>
    Displaying data is just as important as the collection of data and
    the data itself, if not more important​
  </p>
  <p>Data presentation needs to be concise and easy to read​</p>
  <p>
    Capturing the attention of your readers is very important, keep
    them interested and direct them towards the point you are trying
    to get across
